# Domain-Oriented Case Study - Telecom Churn
# Data Preparation and Understanding
## Definitions of Churn: 
In this project, churn will be defined using the usage-based concept. Churn will be identified as customers who have not utilized their account for a period, including making or receiving calls, using the internet, etc.

## High-value Churn:
Recognizing high-value clients is crucial, as approximately 80% of revenue in the Indian and Southeast Asian markets originates from the top 20% of consumers. High-value customers will be defined as those who have recharged with an amount more than or equal to X, where X represents the 70th percentile of the average recharge amount in the first two months (the 'good' phase).

## Understanding Customer Behavior During Churn:
Customer churn typically unfolds over three phases:

1. **The 'good' phase:** During this phase, customers are content and exhibit regular usage behavior.
2. **The 'action' phase:** Issues or offers from competitors may arise, prompting customers to consider alternatives.
3. **The 'churn' phase:** Customers make the decision to leave.
## Data Preparation Steps:
1. **Derive New Features:** New features will be created based on business understanding.
2. **Filter High-Value Customers:** High-value customers will be defined based on their recharge amount.
3. **Tag Churners:** Churned customers will be identified based on their inactivity in the churn phase.
4. **Remove Churn Phase Attributes:** All attributes corresponding to the churn phase will be excluded from the dataset.
# Modelling Approach
## Modelling Goals:
1. **Predict Churn:** Develop a model to predict if a high-value customer is likely to churn.
2. **Identify Important Predictors:** Build an additional model to recognize key features indicating potential churn.
# Suggested Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, format conversions, etc.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Extract insights beneficial for business or feature engineering.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features based on business understanding.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilize PCA to reduce the number of variables.
5. **Model Training:** Train diverse models, address class imbalance.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Use appropriate metrics, with a focus on accurately identifying churners.
7. **Model Selection:** Choose the most suitable model based on evaluation results.
## Additional Model for Feature Importance:
1. **Logistic Regression or Tree Model:** Construct a model to determine significant predictor attributes.
2. **Handling Multi-collinearity:** Ensure multi-collinearity is addressed, particularly for logistic regression models.
3. **Visualizing Feature Importance:** Use plots and tables to present important predictors effectively.
# Recommendations and Strategies:
## For Predicting Churn:
1. Employ the selected model to predict potential churn among high-value customers.
2. This predictive insight can assist the company in proactively offering tailored plans, discounts, or enhancing service quality.
## For Identifying Important Predictors:
1. Utilize the logistic regression or tree model to pinpoint the crucial features indicating churn.
2. Visualize these significant predictors to convey their relevance clearly.
3. Based on these insights, recommendations can be proposed
## Potential Strategies to Manage Customer Churn:
1. **Tailored Offers:** Offer personalized plans or discounts to identified at-risk customers identified through churn prediction.
2. **Enhanced Customer Service ** Address customer concerns promptly and enhance service quality based on identified issues.
3. **Competitor Analysis:** Continually analyze competitor offerings to maintain competitiveness.
4. **Customer Engagement:** Implement strategies to maintain customer engagement and satisfaction, reducing the likelihood of churn.
5. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Establish effective channels for gathering customer feedback to better understand their needs.
6. **Retention Campaigns:** Develop targeted retention campaigns specifically for high-value customers.

By adhering to these steps and implementing the suggested strategies, the telecom company can potentially reduce churn rates, retain high-value customers, and enhance overall customer satisfaction and profitability.
